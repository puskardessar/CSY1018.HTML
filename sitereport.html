<b>Problem arise when trying to make contact form.</b><br>
  The issuse which was arises while making contact format was actually didn't understand what format must we need to put out in page. I didn't have any idea about the think must be included in the contact page. <br><br>

  <b>These problem are solve after such instruction.</b>
  My most of the problem related to the contact page was solved after disscusion class. The disscusion class clarify alot of think related to home page .

  Narthampton Unviversity provide instruction in berif to make CV page that was I need to use columns on this page to demonstrated my skill. The contact must be largerly typical for a CV. while meetind such things some of the problem arises and way how did I solved has been given below.<br><br>
   
  <b>Problem arises while making CV page.</b><br>
  While making CV there are not so much prblm are arises little problem are arises like text over lapping and to select the color.
  <br><br><b> The problmes are solved after such activities. </b><br>There are not so much problem while making cv because of experince increase with making other page and disscusion class also help me. My own cv also help me from starting to ending phase about idea and thinks required for CV. </i><br><br><br> 
 <h2>Navigation bar</h2><p><i>The bar which contain puskar as logo and having a page name like home,cv,portfolio,contact,sitereport etc from where we can easily visit another page with in single click on such item is a navigation bar. Navigation bar was avialable is all pages. During making anavigation bar there are a lots of problem came like text align, maintain its postion, selecting the color and to maintain the margin. Its took lot of time while making a navigation bar as I want to make after all with many try and continousily help me to make the navigation bar as i want. The concept of navigation bar and such idea was arises with disscusion class and self thinking. As navigation bar is one of the most important think which  need to manage in this page without navigation bar its was difficult to coonect one page with another page.  </i></p><br><br>

After a time when I completed my html and css of other page and working in the page of sitereport there was some problem in git hub where I cannot able to git push in main branched some error has been seen in github. Then after with some advice from teacher I did git pull at the date of june 5 with new git clone..which created new file inside my original file where my oldest code in git hub has been pull like, In this file my old upadte  has been pull where my old css and html  are in this folder.There wasnot complete coding of html and css in that file(like I completed my all html and css of all file at june 1 expected sitereport).My all new update has not pull(june 1) only old push has been pull. ( My new clone file shown  given below in picture)
   </p>
    <p><b>The new floder has been highlighted from yellow</b></p>
   <div class="photo-issues"><img src="aa.png" alt=""></div>
  
   <p>After that I again do and git push which was not working then I did <b>git force push</b> which deleted my all the history of May 26 to June 2 where my regular update at main branch has been deleted and final update has only visible in the history main branch like only visible the history of june 5(where I commited at june 5 but git force push at june 6 the file  update has been shown of june 5 ) when I did  git push force other history like git push of may 26 27 28 29..has been deleted of ever html and css file. ALL my git hub activeness was not visible in main branch where I tried alot to restore but  I cannot do rebut.when ever i use to git bash in the main branch it shows main /merging I really cannot rebut my merging. when ever I tried to git bash it shows like.   </p>
   <div class="merging"><img src="don.png" alt=""></div>
   <p>After this I didnot get any idea to rebut then I started to work on new floder which was formed after git pull where old update avilable and then I started to work on that old upadte code  with adding new css and new html file in each page and with some change I used to  updated regularly  in git hub at puskar branch from june 7.(<b>I started my coding at pull file and used to push in puskar branch regular. so my new coding was in puskar</b>).
